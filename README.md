# Installing

## macOS

1. Download the correct `.pkg` installer from the **Releases** page.
2. Open the installer.
3. Follow the installation prompts.

After installation you will find the files in:

```
/Applications/Bambu-Panels
```

---

## Linux

Download the Linux archive and extract it:

```bash
tar -xzf bambu-panels-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd bambu-panels
```

Then run your startup script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

# Preparing the Printer (SSH Setup)

When using **X1-Plus**, the SSH directory may not exist yet.

Create it manually on the printer:

```bash
mkdir -p /root/.ssh
chmod 700 /root/.ssh
```

This ensures SSH keys can be stored correctly.

---

# go2rtc

This project uses **go2rtc** to access and stream the printer camera.

Repository:

https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc

During release builds the correct binary for each platform is automatically downloaded and bundled into the installer.

You do **not** need to manually install go2rtc when using the packaged installers.
